// multiple algorithm exit for the same problem  there is no one right solution.
//different algorithm work well under different constraint.

// Always understand the problem before determining wish one is better.

// the same algorithm with the same programming language can be implemented in different way

// when writing programs at work don't lose sight of  the picture. Rether than write a clever code, write 
//code that is  simple to read and maintain
